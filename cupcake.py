cut the cupcake into 4 equally sized pieces in the shape of an A

area of a circle = pi * r^2
area of a sector = theta / 360 * pi r^2 [sector not what i need]
area of a segment: r^2 / 2 * ( theta - sin theta)

but also, area of this segment is pi * r^2 / 4

so pi * r^2 / 4 = r^2 /2 * (theta - sin theta)
reduces to pi / 2 = theta - sin theta; how to solve from there??
